# Artemisa: PyCode Runtime Compiler for ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers
Artemisa is a runtime compiler for executing Python code, written specifically for microcontrollers based on the ARM Cortex-M architecture. This project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to run Python code on resource-constrained devices, leveraging the flexibility and ease of use of the Python programming language.

## Features
Runtime compilation of Python code in PyCode format, optimized for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.
Minimal resource requirements, making it suitable for use on devices with limited memory and processing power.
Compatible with a wide range of ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, including the popular STM32 series.
Integrated with popular development environments, such as PlatformIO and the Arduino IDE.
Support for a wide range of Python libraries, enabling a broad range of functionality.

## Getting Started
Artemisa is currently in the early stages of development, and is not yet available for general use. However, developers who are interested in contributing to the project can check out the source code from the GitHub repository and build it locally.

To get started with Artemisa, you will need to have the following software installed on your development machine:

Python 3.x

GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain

CMake
